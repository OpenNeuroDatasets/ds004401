A PET Molecular Imaging Brain Atlas of Cyclooxygenase-1 (Kim 2021)

Molecular Imaging Brain Atlases MIBAs are analyzed PET data presented in a format that MRI researchers should find easy to use, including tables of values for default ROIs and volume and surface maps in traditional MRI-based coordinate systems

Public deidentified MRI and PET data were obtained from openneuro.org/datasets/ds004230/versions/2.2.5 for 16 subjects who underwent a [11C]PS13 PET scan, a radioligand that quantifies cyclooxygenase-1 [1]. MRI data were analyzed in FreeSurfer[2]. PET data were analyzed in PETsurfer ([3, 4],surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PetSurfer) using the Logan method [5] to quantify the distribution volume (VT). A Cyclooxygenase-1 MIBA was generated by computing averages and standard deviations of VT across subject in ROI tables and in voxel-wise maps on the MNI152 and the FreeSurfer fsaverage brain.

Notes:

- The files `participants.json` and `participants.tsv` are from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004332/versions/1.0.2
- The folder `sub-dummy` should be ignored.  It is only there so the dataset passes validation
- `nii.gz` files with the `res` entity are in volumetric space
- `nii.gz` files with the `hemi` entity are freesurfer surface overlays and are designed to be overlayed on top of the 164k surface mesh (see `SpatialReference` in corresponding `.json` files)
- `desc` entity legend:
  - nopvc: No partial volume correction
  - pvc: Partial volume correction
  - fnirtNopvc: Non-linear registration performed with fnirt; No partial volume correction
  - fnirtPvc: Non-linear registration performed with fnirt; Partial volume correction
  - spmvbmNopvc: Non-linear registration performed with spmvbm; No partial volume correction
  - spmvbmPvc: Non-linear registration performed with spmvbm; Partial volume correction
