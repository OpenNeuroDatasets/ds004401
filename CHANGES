1.2.0 2023-07-17
  - Harmonizing with latest consensus for BIDS atlas spec
  - Adding atlases that have been partial volume corrected
  - Adding atlases in an additional space, mni152, with 1) linear registration 2) non-linear registration via fnirt and 3) non-linear registration via vbm (from spm)
1.3.0 2023-07-21
  - OHBM version
  - `res` entity has been changed from `2` to `1p5` for `spmvbm` files
  - `"Resolution"` has been broken up into `"Resolution"` and `"ResolutionUnits"` in all json files.
  - `hemi` entity has been changed from `lh` or `rh` to `L` or `R` to conform with spec
  - `"Hemishpere"` has been added to the json of all surface overlays
  - `"Resolution"` has been replaced with `"Density"` in the json for surface overlay files
  - `"SpatialReference"` for right hemisphere overlays has been corrected (was pointing to left hemi)
  - `"SpatialReference"` has been removed from spmvbm json files have since there is no template flow file to reference
